We describe an assessment of goal neglect developed for administration to preschool children and report data on two measures derived from this task alongside the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) and an opposite color response inhibition task. The propensity to neglect initial task cues was uniquely linked to response inhibition, whereas neglect of a later cue was uniquely linked to the DCCS. Additional evidence suggests that recovery from neglect can occur and shows that goal neglect varies with the cognitive transparency of the signifying cue. Data demonstrate the importance of, and place constraints on, current theories of information regulation and foreground the notion of graded representations in working memory and executive functioning."

            "description" : "Despite the increasing use of the microgenetic methodology to examine change, the techniques employed to analyse microgenetic data remain fairly unsophisticated. This paper reviews the existing ways of analysing such data and describes their limitations. We use two recent studies to illustrate how modelling can avoid these problems and reveal important aspects of children\'s cognitive development. The first example illustrates the use of quasi-binomial modelling to examine 6- and 7-year olds\' analogical reasoning development. This method offered insights into the way in which children develop, in terms of the rate and path of change, and how different instructional cues can affect their performance. The second study employs a random effects logistic model to analyse the development of preschoolers\' counting skills. This technique was employed to examine different influences on children\'s use of counting to compare quantities. We argue that the key benefit of such modelling approaches is that they are able to tap into the process of change whilst not compromising statistical assumptions."

The case study is a qualitative sociological autopsy of suicide and  the secondary data \u2013 written documents and photographs - are all from case  files in a British coroner\u2019s office. After some ethnographic detail about the  research setting and research process, there is some discussion in the paper of  the diverse secondary data sources in these files, particularly in relation to the  impact on the researcher. Some general observations are made about emotion  in the research process and potential strategies for responding to emotion. The  authors locate their responses to reading about suicides within the broader  context of the social processing of death and distress and also consider  whether or not emotional reactions to data have any analytical purchase."

We restrict ourselves to the use of these methods to analyse  panel data. By panel data we mean data which contain repeated measures of the same variable,  taken from the same set of units over time. In our applications the units are individuals.  However, the methods presented can be used for other types of units, such as businesses or  countries. The paper does not provide details of specific software packages, and focuses in the  main on procedures which are available in standard software. By using exemplars we provide a  guide for substantive social scientists new to the area of panel data analysis, but who have a  working knowledge of generalized linear models."

Many of the major challenges facing UK society depend on improving understanding on why people behave as they do and how to maximise the effectiveness with which individuals can take control of their own lives. The leading edge is to bring together the different groups of scientists from very different perspectives into a meaningful scientific endeavour which adds value via its interdisciplinary approach. The complexity of analysing human behaviour, as well as the challenges of cross-disciplinary working, both within and between the biological, physical, biomedical and social sciences, means achieving this aim will be especially demanding."

            "description" : "This document outlines some thoughts and discussions we have been having  about strategies of anonymisation of data to be collected through the ESRC /  NCRM Real Life Methods Node Connected Lives project1. It is commonplace for  social science research to adopt a policy of \u2018blanket anonymisation\u2019, whereby all  names, places and other identifying features are disguised across a data set,  including from interview transcripts, diaries and field notes. Here, I consider the  practical and theoretical implications of such a strategy and suggest that  anonymisation is not a process to be conducted \u2013 and assumed completed \u2013 at  just one stage of the research process. Moreover, anonymisation strategies  cannot be separated out from other methodological (such as issues around  archiving or mixing methods) or indeed substantive issues (such as enabling  deeper appreciation of the relationality of networks, or the ways in which space  might be constructed). The implications of whatever anonymisation strategy  researchers adopt on the future ability to appreciate the social and spatial  processes behind networks, neighbourhoods and communities, need to be made  clear throughout the research process. In summation, this document argues for  a more reflexive, iterative approach to anonymisation and confidential that  situates these, and other ethical concerns, in the context of the social process."

            "description" : "The relative index of inequality (RII) is a commonly used measure of the extent to which the occurrence of an outcome such as chronic illness or early death varies with socioeconomic status or some other background variable. The standard RII estimator applies only to linear variation in incidence rates. In this paper a general definition of the RII is introduced, alternative approaches to point estimation are considered, and a parametric bootstrap method is suggested for the construction of approximate confidence intervals. Estimation based on cubic splines fitted by maximum penalized likelihood is developed in some detail, and the proposed approach handles naturally the commonly needed adjustment for a \u2018standardizing\u2019 covariate such as age. Death rates in a large longitudinal study in England and Wales from 1996\u20132000 are analyzed in order to illustrate the various methods. A small simulation study explores the relative merits of different estimators. The approach based on cubic splines is found to reduce bias substantially, at the expense of some increase in variance, when variation in incidence rates is nonlinear."

We outline the requirements and expectations of institutional ethics review boards and legal frameworks, for example regarding filming and photographing in public and issues of copyright. We contend that legal and institutional requirements should not be the sole determinants when making decisions about ethics but rather must be situated within the research context  and accommodated in a researcher\u2019s individual moral framework. We suggest that visual methods, and the data they produce, challenge some of the ethical practices associated with word and number based research, in particular around  informed consent, anonymity and confidentiality, and dissemination strategies. Overall, we argue that research ethics are contested, dynamic and contextual and as such, are best approached through detailed understanding of  the concrete, everyday situations in which they are applied. The title of this paper \u2018visual ethics at the crossroads\u2019 is metaphorical, indicating that visual research has reached an important juncture and signifying it is timely to take  stock and move in new direction."

            "description" : "Using high quality data from Norwegian population registers, we examine the relationship between family disruption and children\u2019s educational outcomes.  We distinguish between disruptions caused by parental divorce and paternal death and, using a simultaneous equation model, pay particular attention to selection bias in the effect of divorce.  We also allow for the possibility that disruption may have different effects at different stages of a child\u2019s educational career.  Our results suggest that selection on time-invariant maternal characteristics is important and works to overstate the effects of divorce on a child\u2019s chances of continuing in education.  Nevertheless, we find that the experience of marital breakdown during childhood is associated with lower levels of education, and that the effect weakens with the child\u2019s age at disruption.  The effects of divorce are most pronounced for the transitions during or just beyond the high school level.  In models that do not allow for selection, children who experienced a father\u2019s death appear less disadvantaged than children whose parents divorced.  After controlling for selection, however, differences in the educational qualifications of children from divorced and bereaved families narrow substantially and, at mean ages of disruption, are almost non-existent."

We describe a MCMC algorithm for fitting such models. We show how this unifies a number of disparate problems, including partially observed data and missing data in generalised linear modelling. The 2-level model is considered in detail with worked examples of applications to a prediction problem and to multiple imputation for missing data. We conclude with a discussion outlining possible extensions and connections in the literature. Software for estimating the models is freely available."

Firstly, it introduces how contemporary  sociological approaches to the study of childhood can enable us to make sense  of the social worlds of children and young people. Secondly, the chapter reports  on how we are drawing on such approaches to inform the establishment of an  on-going research project with looked after children, (Extra)ordinary Lives, and  some findings from the research are presented. Thirdly, the chapter explores  the relevance of sociological approaches to the study of childhood for direct  practice, drawing out implications of both the research methods and some of  the research findings fo r those who work with children and young people."

It acknowledges \'context\' for the actions of economic actors. And it admits historical time into economics, via  \'path dependency\' of firms\' capabilities, trajectories of product innovation, and the durability and stickiness of knowledge and capability."

            "description" : "To reanalyse and historically situate WS Robinson\u2019s highly  influential study that laid the foundation for conceptualizing and  analysing data at the individual level by ignoring other levels.  Methods We applied a binomial multilevel logistic model to analyse variation in  illiteracy as enumerated by the 1930 US. Census (the same data as  10 used by Robinson). The outcome was log odds of being illiterate, while  predictors were race/nativity (\u2018native whites\u2019, \u2018foreign-born whites\u2019  and \u2018negroes\u2019) at the individual-level, and presence of Jim Crow  segregation laws for education at the state-level. We conducted  historical research to identify the social and scientific context within  15 which Robinson\u2019s study was produced and favourably received.    Empirically, the substantial state variations in illiteracy could not be  accounted by the states\u2019 race/nativity composition. Different approaches  to modelling state-effects yielded considerably attenuated  associations at the individual-level between illiteracy and race/  20 nativity. Furthermore, state variation in illiteracy was different  across the race/nativity groups, with state variation being largest for  whites and least for foreign-born whites. Strong effects of Jim Crow  education laws on illiteracy were observed with the effect being strongest  for blacks. Historically, Robinson\u2019s study was consonant with the  25 post-World War II ascendancy of methodological individualism.    Applying a historically informed multilevel perspective to Robinson\u2019s  profoundly influential study, we demonstrate that meaningful  analysis of individual-level relationships requires attention to  substantial heterogeneity in state characteristics. The implication is  30 that perils are posed by not only ecological fallacy but also  individualistic fallacy. Multilevel thinking, grounded in historical  and spatiotemporal context, is thus a necessity, not an option."

Data on over 47,000 male and 10,000 female offenders for six specific birth cohorts (those born in 1953, 1958, 1963, 1968, 1973 and 1978) were extracted from the Offenders Index. We related convictions in three age groups (10\u201415, 16\u201420, 21\u201425) to population estimates for these age groups. Striking differences in the conviction rates over time were observed for both males and females. There is a remarkable decline among the 10\u201415 age group for more recent cohorts which echoes the increasing use of court diversionary procedures in this age group. There is no corresponding increase in conviction rates for the later age groups. These figures suggest that efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s to divert offenders away from court convictions have been successful, and that such diversionary schemes need to be encouraged."

            "description" : "Understanding the role of multiple colour signals during sexual signalling is a central theme in animal communication. We quantified the role of multiple colour signals (including ultraviolet, UV), measures of body size and testosterone levels in settling disputes between male rivals in an elaborately ornamented, African lizard, played out in a large \u2018tournament\u2019 in the wild. The hue and brightness (total reflectance) of the UV throat in Augrabies flat lizards, Platysaurus broadleyi, as well as body size, were consistent and strong predictors of \u2018fighting ability\u2019. Males with high fighting ability were larger and displayed a UV throat with low total reflectance. In contrast, males with low fighting ability were smaller and had violet throats with broader spectral reflectance curves (higher total reflectance). As fighting ability is associated with alternative reproductive tactics in this system (territorial versus floater), we also examined the role of colour signals in predicting male reproductive tactic. Territorial males had UV throats with higher chroma but had poorer body condition than floater males, probably because of the energetic costs of maintaining a territory. Although testosterone was not a significant predictor of fighting ability or reproductive tactic, it was correlated with the hue of the UV throat, suggesting that testosterone may impose some constraint on signal expression. Lastly, we show that within the context of the natural signalling environment, UV-reflective throats constitute a conspicuous, effective signal that male Augrabies flat lizards use to advertise their status honestly to rivals."

We hope that this seminar will prove to be an interesting introduction to network analysis for those previously unacquainted with it, which will both inspire and equip them to participate in the later seminars."

It  considers the convictions of six cohorts involving 57,000 young adults aged 16-20 in  the early 1970s, the late 1970s, the early 1980s, the late 1980s, the early 1990s and the  late 1990s. Using latent class analysis, 16 offence clusters for males and 5 offence  clusters for females were identified.  For both males and females, the proportions of the population convicted in the  16-20 age group have declined. Among the males, \u2018versatile\u2019 clusters are increasing  and \u2018specialist\u2019 clusters, with some exceptions, are rapidly declining. Among  females, the proportions in the versatile cluster have increased appreciably, while the  two specialist clusters \u2013 relating to violence and shoplifting \u2013 have moved in opposite  directions."

            "format" :      "application/pdf",
            "description" : "This is an overview of different approaches to the study of social networks,  relationships and contacts situated in the context of debates on the  interpretation of the changing nature of \u2018community\u2019. Three approaches are  considered; a traditional \u2018community as locality\u2019 approach that sees contacts as  bound to a particular geographic location; \u2018social network analysis\u2019 that  considers the \u2018networked\u2019 nature of an individuals\u2019 contacts; and the idea that  individuals are connected through \u2018small worlds\u2019 that attempt to understand the  linked nature of different networks (see Larsen et al., 2005).  Implicit in these competing approaches is the link between \u2018community\u2019 and  social networks (though the two are far from mutually exclusive). This is  particularly evident in explanations of how social, spatial and technological  change has altered the ways in which social relations are ordered. Simplified,  this forms a somewhat evolutionary narrative of shifts in the organisation of  social relations from \u2018face-to-face\u2019, to \u2018place-to-place\u2019, to \u2018person-centred\u2019  contacts and relationships (Wellman, 2001). It is the later, encapsulated in ideas  such as \u2018networked sociality\u2019, that some suggest has had most impact on our  understandings of social networks and community (Wittel, 2001). This is evident  in discussions of how the rise of instantaneous communication technology such  as the internet, e.mail or mobile phones have facilitated the \u2018death of distance\u2019  and enabled individuals to overcome the problem of time when contacting  others (Cairncross, 2001). As the review goes on to discuss, this does not mean  that the need for embodied travel or face-to-face contact is now redundant. If  anything, some argue that travel has increased in frequency and distance, and  produced more dispersed and flexible social ties which continue to be  maintained through ever complex processes of physical co-presence (Urry, 2002;  2003).  While some present almost utopian claims about networked individualism and  how new travel and communication technologies can empower individuals to  \u2018choose\u2019 or create better networks, and therefore better social lives, the review  warns of the dangers of overlooking what, for many, is exclusion from the  ability to engage in such socially enabling networking. Furthermore, the alleged  \u2018death of distance\u2019 and freedom from spatial fixity of networked individualism  has not eradicated the relevance of the spatial and temporal contexts of social  networks."

            "description" : "The paper develops an argument that the two conventional forms of comparative analysis  which seek to explain similar phenomena by similar features, and different phenomena  by different features are too restricted. Instead using the idea of plural causation two  other possibilities are identified: explaining similar phenomena by different features (e.g.  showing how a phenomenon occurs due to one set of causes in one society and another in  another) and explaining different phenomena by similar features (e.g. as in functionalist  explanations which explain different phenomena as ways of meeting the same societal  functions.) The resulting four varieties of comparative analysis are illustrated. The second  part of the paper draws on some recent research on environmental regulation in Hungary  to address two questions: 1. the similarity in patterns of environmental regulation across  nations and 2. inter-locality variation in patterns of environmental regulation in Hungary.  In the former case the similarity in the pattern in Hungary to that in North American and  western European capitalist countries can usefully be explained as occurring in part  through a distinctive set of causes, i.e. socialist legacies."

            "description" : "In keeping with recent critiques of literature on the body and the life course, the argument of this paper is that social identities can, to a certain extent, be  constructed post-mortem and in the absence of a living body. The authors make this case with reference to a sociological autopsy study of a hundred suicide  case files in a coroners\u2019 office in a medium-sized British city. The research draws on ethnographic approaches to documents. There is discussion of some of the diverse data sources in the coroners\u2019 files: medical reports, witness  statements and suicide notes. The identity work revealed in these sources is as much about the living as the dead and is especially bound up in the process of avoiding blame."

This article presents an inferential methodology based on the GEE approach. This method involves the approximations of the marginal likelihood and joint moments of the variables. It is also proposed an approximate Akaike and Bayesian information criterions based on the approximate marginal likelihood using the estimation of the parameters by the GEE approach. The different results are illustrated with a simulation study and with an analysis of real data from health-related quality of life."

            "description" : "The focus of this article is on the changing patterns of offending among young people (aged  16-20 years) over time. Using six \u2018birth cohorts\u2019 aged 16-20 in the late 1960s, early 1970s,  late 1970s, early 1980s, late 1980s, early 1990s and late 1990s, the study shows that crime  participation \u2013 in terms of the proportions ever convicted \u2013 declined for both males and  females. There has also been an overall shift from more \u2018specialist\u2019 criminal behaviour to  more \u2018versatile\u2019 behaviour. While the gap between male and female offending is narrowing,  the differences remain large. Although fewer young people are coming before the courts, the  changing case mix has probably influenced the perception that offending is getting worse. As  those committing \u2018lesser\u2019 offences are being dealt with by other means, there are higher  proportions of young people coming before the courts who exhibit greater versatility and  more violence."

This paper  provides and overview of approaches and perspectives broken down into five easily  digested sections to be consumed wholly or in part: early visual research; researcher  created data; respondent created data; research design; and visual ethics. The paper will  be of particular interest to qualitative social scientists new to visual methods or those with  little experience of their application. A wide range of carefully selected references and  resources are included to provide the reader with further in-depth insights."

The aim of this text is  both to introduce the reader to the basic concept of GWR through several empirical examples and also to demonstrate how to run GWR with software specifically written for  this purpose. The software, GWR 3.0, is available from the authors and details can be found at: http://ncg.nuim.ie/GWR It is highly recommended that this software be used in conjunction with this text. It should be noted that GWR 3.0 produces a set of localised statistics that can be imported into other software for mapping."

The friction between the novelty of the archive for social scientists, and the very ordinariness of the archive for historians, seems a productive tension with which to start. The sense that the archive is the site of the trace of the old, the place of collective memory, underlies anxieties about the suitability of the archive for researching the sociological present. Questioning assumed temporalities of the archive seem key to unpacking our understandings of the possibilities of archival research. As well as examining the key disciplines engaged in archives, we will also consider the impact of the work of Foucault and Derrida on archives, and Latour and ANT on laboratories, and those informed by these theorists across disciplines. Whether the archive is understood as a place, a site of texts and artefacts where history is documented or as a process whereby knowledge is produced through the assemblage of artefacts, archiving techniques and disciplinary research practices, the aim will be to unpack how these different ontologies of the archive inform how the possibilities of archival research are imagined."

            "format" :      "application/pdf",
            "description" : "In this paper I provide a review of the literature related to mixing modes of data collection in surveys. The paper is structured in the following way: I begin with an overview of the range of mode choices available to survey researchers and their advantages and disadvantages with respect to a range of criteria, including their impact on data quality (so-called \u2018mode effects\u2019). Increasingly, survey designers are exploiting the potential offered by using a combination of data collection modes, either to offset the weaknesses of a particular mode with the strengths of another (Dillman, 2000) or, for example, to try to reduce the overall costs of fieldwork. The paper describes the major challenges involved in mixing modes, focusing in particular on the problem of mode effects on measurement error \u2013 or how people respond to survey questions. Modes of data collection appear to affect respondents\u2019 answers by influencing either a) the amount of effort needed to answer the question; or b) the respondents\u2019 willingness to answer questions honestly (Holbrook et al., 2003). The first type of influence can lead to a range of response errors referred to as \u2018satisficing effects\u2019 (Krosnick, 1991), while the second type of influence can lead to a tendency to give socially desirable answers. Mode effects have implications for the comparability of data collected in different modes; understanding their causes is, therefore, an important step in developing ways of reducing the negative impact of mixing modes on data quality. After describing some mechanisms through which modes result in measurement error, I discuss what, if anything, researchers can do to tackle the problem."

Several  models have been well-established for the study of data coming from  small areas.  In this paper we have made a comparison of some of these methods  paying attention to how dierent types of data sets can be employed  eciently and how to deal with the estimation in areas for which no di-  rect individual data area available. We have considered design-based,  regression and EBLUP estimators, which have been tted using both a  likelihood-based and a Bayesian approach. Spatial correlation among  areas has also been considered. As in any study of the performance  of dierent models, we have also compared dierent criteria for model  comparisson and selection."

This is because the \'field\' and relationships stemming therefrom have been central in defining the nature of anthropological knowledge itself. The past two decades have especially been marked by watershed debates to do with the anthropological politics of locating the \'field\' in relation to research and researcher (Clifford and Marcus 1986, Marcus and  Fisher 1986, Gupta and Ferguson 1997 are good representatives of these shifts for the  1980s and 1990s respectively). Yet, despite this disciplinary reflection, the setting up  and practice of actual guidelines for ethical conduct has been relatively slow, given impetus largely when the researched communities themselves have raised concerns or  when anthropologists have undertaken fieldwork at \'home\'."

            "description" : "This paper provides an alternative methodology for the analysis of a set of Likert responses measured on a common attitudinal scale when the primary focus of interest is on the relative importance of items in the set. The method makes fewer assumptions about the distribution of the responses than the more usual approaches such as comparisons of means, MANOVA or ordinal data methods. The approach transforms the Likert responses into paired comparison responses between the items. The complete multivariate pattern of responses thus produced can be analyzed by an appropriately reformulated paired comparison model. The dependency structure between item responses can also be modelled flexibly. The advantage of this approach is that sets of Likert responses can be analyzed simultaneously within the Generalized Linear Model framework, providing standard likelihood-based inference for model selection. This method is applied to a recent international survey on the importance of environmental problems."

Its focus is on the  ethical issues associated with research using photographs, film and video  images (created by researchers, respondents or others) rather than other  visual methods. It is intended as an introduction to assist researchers in  identifying what ethical issues might arise in undertaking visual research and  how these might be addressed. The review commences with an outline of  research ethics frameworks, professional guidance, regulation and legal rights  and duties which, to varying degrees, shape visual researchers\u2019 ethical  decision making. It then goes on to explore the core ethical issues of  consent, confidentiality and anonymity and discusses the ethical  considerations that these raise with examples of how these can be managed.  The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the ethical issues raised in  relation to the construction and consumption of images. The authors stress  the importance of researchers engaging with theories (or approaches) to  research ethics in their ethical decision making in order to protect the  reputation and integrity of visual research."

            "description" : "This paper comprises a literature review outlining the current issues and debates relating to informed consent in social research. Given the rapidly changing nature of the field it draws primarily on literature published between 1998-2004. However, it includes some papers and books  published prior to this where these are viewed as having made an important contribution to issues and debates around informed consent. The paper focuses primarily on consent in relation to qualitative research comprising \u2018traditional\u2019 methods of data collection, such as interviews and observation. It does not does not engage with the many complex ethical issues relating to research  using visual methods and new digital technologies nor does it engage with the issues of consent in relation to quantitative research both of which, while important, are beyond the scope of this paper. The paper explores issues of informed consent in qualitative social research in general but focuses specifically on research conducted with so called \u2018vulnerable\u2019 groups (to include children, older people and people with a range of physical and mental health problems) in that issues of consent are perceived as being particularly pertinent when conducting research with these groups. This review outlines the regulatory, ethical and legal context for consent in social research and the operationalisation of informed consent in practice. This review was conducted as part of a project funded within the ESRC Research Methods Programme 2002-2004."

            "description" : "The problem of analysing longitudinal data that are complicated by possibly informative drop-out has received considerable attention in the statistical literature. Most researchers have concentrated on either methodology or application, but we begin this paper by arguing that more attention could be given to study objectives and to the relevant targets for inference. Next we summarize a variety of approaches that have been suggested for dealing with drop-out. A long-standing concern in this subject area is that all methods require untestable assumptions. We discuss circumstances in which we are willing to make such assumptions and we propose a new and computationally efficient modelling and analysis procedure for these situations. We assume a dynamic linear model for the expected increments of a constructed variable, under which subject-specific random effects follow a martingale process in the absence of drop-out. Informal diagnostic procedures to assess the tenability of the assumption are proposed. The paper is completed by simulations and a comparison of our method and several alternatives in the analysis of data from a trial into the treatment of schizophrenia, in which approximately 50% of recruited subjects dropped out before the final scheduled measurement time."

Sibling analyses in developmental psychology and behavioural genetics have largely ignored sources of shared environmental variation beyond the immediate family. In this paper we formulate a multilevel cross-classified model that examines variation in children\'s progress during secondary schooling and partitions this variability into pupil, family, primary school, secondary school, local education authority and residential area. Our results suggest that about 50% of what has been labelled as pupil variation in school effectiveness models is really between family variation and that about 22% of the total variance is due is due to shared environments beyond the immediate family"

This experimental study explores this issue using conjoint analysis -an innovative  methodological approach in criminology. Analysis using a random effects ordinal  logistic regression model allowed determination of those factors deemed by young  adults to be of relevance to the assessment and management of dangerous offenders.  The significant factors identified as relevant to perceptions of dangerousness and the  need to monitor such offenders closely were: schizophrenia, a previous history of a  sexual conviction, a violent conviction or robbery. The victim target group was also  relevant. Using the research methodologies described, it was possible to demonstrate  that in making these decisions, young adults are able to apply a systematic approach  to discriminate between a range of risk factors."

To do this the article presents cross-sectional and longitudinal data that illustrate the relative isolation of the single-country canon, especially non-domestic single-country studies, within the wider discipline of political science. To suggest how this be readdressed, the article then discusses how single-country scholarship might build bridges to the comparative approach and the benefits this might generate. The article argues that careful and innovative use of the case study research design provides the ideal means to do this."

            "description" : "This is a systematic study of the social background of Danish males convicted for the first time of lethal violence, either actual or potential (e.g. unlawful killers, attempted homicides, negligent homicide, grievous bodily harm, n = 125). Using registers, the paper addresses the following question: Do young men, convicted of a lethal violent crime (either actual or potential), have the same kind of risk factors related to social disadvantage as other first-time convicted violent offenders (n = 1,849) and first-time attempted suicides or completed suicides (n = 476)? The paper describes three separate analyses of the total 1966 birth cohort followed through a 13-year period from age 15 to 27 (n = 43,403). In each case the discrete-time Cox model is used to analyse associations between the relatively rare response events and the relatively rare stress factors. Results suggest that all three groups of subjects have a similar exposure to risk conditions, but also that there are important differences in the predictors for the three groups when the risk factors are analysed one by one. So, for example, the experience of domestic violence during adolescence is a strong predictor of males\' later violent behaviour but a less strong predictor of suicidal behaviour. In contrast, being battered and being neglected during childhood more strongly predict later suicidal behaviour than violent behaviour. The implications for prevention are considered."

The primary aim of the network is to synthesise methodological expertise and to encourage methodological innovation arising from this process of interaction across epistemological and disciplinary backgrounds, drawing on work in post-structuralist discourse theory, interpretative policy analysis, Q-methodology, critical discourse analysis and discursive psychology. It specifically seeks to investigate two substantive questions, namely processes involved in the identification and delimitation of specific discourses; and also an exploration of the range of techniques available for the analysis of discourses."

            "description" : "Using a complete birth cohort of all young men born in 1966 in Denmark (N = 43,403), the prevalence of a first-time drink-driving conviction among young men is estimated. More than 7% of the total male birth cohort was so convicted before the age of 27 years. In an examination of risk factors for a first-time drink-driving conviction, young adults coming from potentially vulnerable groups have an increased risk. Earlier criminal convictions of various types were also significant predictors of drink driving. Situational pressures also play a part and are controlled for, with the risk of a drink-driving conviction increased substantially in rural areas compared to metropolitan areas. The study concludes that disadvantages during adolescence, including parental substance abuse, having a teenage mother, and domestic violence, are associated with a first-time drink-driving conviction."

Having good area level  estimates is important because policies will often be based on this type of information.  In this paper we describe how Bayesian hierarchical models can help in the task of  providing good quality small area estimates. Starting from direct estimates obtained  from survey data, we describe a range of Bayesian hierarchical models  that incorporate different types of random effects and show that these give improved  estimates. Models that synthesise individual and aggregated information  are considered as well. Finally, we highlight some additional applications that further  exploit the estimates produced, such as the classification of areas and how  to approach the problem of missing data."

            "description" : "A key question in early number development is how 4- and 5-year-olds learn the roles that counting and cardinal numbers play when comparing quantities. Children who wrongly used length to identify numerosity were assigned to five experimental groups and trained to judge whether a puppet \u2013 who sometimes miscounted \u2013 created equivalent sets. Over three training sessions, children who were asked to compare sets after they were counted learned to base their judgments on cardinal numbers when the puppet counted accurately by being given feedback. However, only the groups who were also asked to explain either their own or the experimenter\'s reasoning made progress in identifying the puppet\'s miscounts. This ability to recognize the importance of counting accuracy for quantitative comparisons predicted whether children would spontaneously count to compare sets on a post-test. The importance of asking children to identify miscounts is discussed alongside the social factors that influence children\'s recognition of the relationship between procedural counting, cardinality and relative number."

            "description" : "Kidnapping has been a neglected crime in criminological research. In fact, there has been a dramatic increase in the yearly numbers of police recorded kidnapping offences in England and Wales in the last 25 years, but this has not been matched by a similar increase in convictions. This study focuses on the official criminal histories of the 7042 males and 545 females who were convicted at least once for kidnapping between 1979 and 2001. Of these, 3.9% of the males and 2.6% of the females had convictions for kidnapping on more than one occasion.   We examined two subgroups to ensure long observation periods for prior and subsequent convictions. Of those convicted of kidnapping in 2001, around one-half (51.1%) of the males and around one-third (36.6%) of the females had previous convictions. The previous convictions consist of a wide range of offences, with the most common being theft and violent offences. A 20-year follow-up of those convicted in 1979-81 showed that three in five males and one in three females are subsequently convicted on at least one more occasion for a standard-list offence.   An examination of convictions for other offences brought to court at the same time as the kidnap offence enabled a typology of kidnaps to be proposed. Those kidnaps with co-convictions of an acquisitive nature declined over the period, whereas other types, including sexual and violent, showed rises. Changing shifts in the nature of kidnaps have important policy implications."

In response to this, methods for undertaking these syntheses are currently being developed. Thematic analysis is a method that is often used to analyse data in primary qualitative research. This paper reports on the use of this type of analysis in systematic reviews to bring together and integrate the findings of multiple qualitative studies. We describe the activity of thematic synthesis, outline several steps for its conduct and illustrate the process and outcome of this approach using a completed review of health promotion and public health research. We compare thematic synthesis to other methods for the synthesis of qualitative research and discuss issues of context and rigour."

This research is necessarily \'multi-sited.\' We deal with policy and practice at different levels, drawing on case histories, village-level ethnography, observations of clinical practice in town and in the countryside, as well as interviews and some participant observation in NGO and activist settings. Inevitably we draw on our own networks in Uganda and our own experience. In this sense, our research collaboration has involved more than \'following the medicines.\' It has also become a matter of learning how to make use of the different positioned experiences  of our diverse research team. The methodological significance of multiple positions was not part of our research designs but rather something we came to recognize serendipitously as work progressed. It is still being  explored, making this contribution very much a work in progress."

            "description" : "Missing data are often a problem in social science data. Imputation methods fill in the missing responses and lead, under certain conditions, to valid inference. This article reviews several imputation methods used in the social sciences and discusses advantages and disadvantages of these methods in practice. Simpler imputation methods as well as more advanced methods, such as fractional and multiple imputation, are considered. The paper introduces the reader new to the imputation literature to key ideas and methods. For those already familiar with imputation methods the paper highlights some new developments and clarifies some recent misconceptions in the use of  imputation methods. The emphasis is on efficient hot deck imputation methods, implemented in either multiple or fractional imputation approaches. Software packages for using imputation methods in practice are reviewed highlighting newer developments. The paper discusses an  example from the social sciences in detail, applying several imputation methods to a missing earnings variable. The objective is to illustrate how to choose between methods in a real data example. A simulation study evaluates various imputation methods, including predictive mean matching, fractional and multiple imputation. Certain forms of fractional and multiple hot deck methods are found to perform well with regards to bias and efficiency of a point estimator and robustness against model misspecifications. Standard parametric imputation methods are not found adequate for the application considered."

            "description" : "The interrelationships between serious types of crime have been neglected. Focusing on those convicted of arson (n = 45,915), blackmail (n = 5,774), kidnapping (n = 7,291) and threats to kill (n = 9,816) in England and Wales (1979\u20132001), we examine the specialization and sequencing of these crimes in relation to the risk of subsequent homicide. All four offences have a heightened likelihood of subsequent homicide compared to the general population. Arson, blackmail and threats to kill have a similar homicide risk (0.8 per cent) after a 20-year follow-up; in contrast, kidnapping has a higher likelihood (1.0 per cent). Sequencing is also relevant, with those convicted of more than one type of serious offence being at higher risk of a homicide conviction. Additionally, there is evidence of specialization (particularly for arsonists) among serious offenders who recidivate."

            "description" : "Traditionally, studies of intrasexual selection have focused on single traits that are more exaggerated in males. Relatively little is known about systems in which traits are larger in females or the role of multiple traits in male contests. We used a tournament design in which each male encounters a series of different opponents, in conjunction with the structured Bradley\u2013Terry model, to examine the role of multiple male traits in contests between male Cape dwarf chameleons, Bradypodion pumilum. Females are larger but males have relatively longer tails, larger and more ornamented heads and a larger central flank patch, all of which are emphasized during agonistic displays. We found no evidence that larger body size confers an advantage in male contests, despite high levels of aggression and escalated encounters. However, both the height of the casque (head ornament) and relative area of the flank patch were positively associated with fighting ability, and not correlated with each other, suggesting that they may represent independent sources of information about an opponent\'s ability. We discuss these results in relation to the role of male contest competition in the evolution of multiple male signals and sexual dimorphism in dwarf chameleons. In addition, we show that the use of tournament designs, in conjunction with the structured Bradley\u2013Terry model, has important advantages over traditional designs and methods of analysing animal contests."

In Experiment 1, forty 3.5- and 4-year-old Koreans showed ceiling performance on inhibition and switching measures, although their performance on working memory and false belief was comparable to that of Western children. Experiment 2 revealed a similar advantage in a sample of seventy-six 3- and 4-year-old Koreans compared with sixty-four age-matched British children. Korean children younger than 3.5 years of age showed ceiling effects on some inhibition measures despite more stringent protocols and the link between executive function and mental state understanding was not as strong as in the British sample. The results raise key questions about the nature and development of the executive system and its relation to social understanding."

            "format" :      "application/pdf",
            "description" : "This paper provides a detailed analysis of the participative processes of a  research project with young people that was overtly \u2018participative\u2019 in its aim. In  doing so it attempts to contribute to debates about participative research. In this  paper we join with others in critiquing the notion that research which aims to be  participative is necessarily more enabling for participants, is ethically or morally  superior to other types of research or produces \u2018better\u2019 research. Nonetheless,  we argue that participatory research can make a central contribution, in  providing an ethical, epistemological and political framework and in the potential  for rich \u2018findings\u2019. We understand participative research with children and young  people to mean that which involves participants in some of the process of  research, such as question-setting, research design, ethical review, data  generation, analysis or dissemination rather than simply providing data through  more or less engaging methods. We understand participation as not being  something just about children or about children in opposition to adults, but as  part of a complex inter-subjective relationship between adults and children  (where both adults and children are being encouraged to step outside normative  generational roles). An analysis of participation can potentially examine microexchanges  between adults and children, between children, and between adults,  as well as a broader picture. In what follows we argue that, whilst the discipline  of childhood studies has engaged critically with the notion of children\u2019s  participation in society, there has been less critical discussion, and perhaps  indeed some complacency, about the claims made for participatory research  with children."

One of the key means of  achieving this is through the Centre\u2019s training and capacity building  programme. The Centre (comprising Hub and Nodes) runs an annual  programme of training, development and awareness raising events. Each  year the Hub and Nodes propose a programme of events drawing on the  needs identified within their communities and via training needs assessments.  The final programme is then agreed at an annual meeting In May each year.  The programme is publicised via the NCRM website and training database as  well as through other Centre networks."

            "description" : "In this paper we consider the application of MCMC estimation methods to random effects models and in particular the family of discrete-time survival models.  Survival models can be used in many situations in the medical and social sciences and we illustrate their use through two examples that differ in terms of both substantive area and data structure. A multilevel discrete-time survival analysis involves expanding the dataset so that the model can be cast as a standard multilevel binary response model. For such models it has been shown that MCMC methods have advantages in terms of reducing estimate bias.  However the data expansion results in very large datasets for which MCMC estimation is often slow and can produce chains that exhibit poor mixing. Any way of improving the mixing will result in both speeding up of the methods and more confidence in the estimates produced. The MCMC methodological literature is full of alternative algorithms designed to improve mixing of chains and we describe three reparameterisation techniques that are easy to implement in available software. We consider two examples of multilevel survival analysis: incidence of mastitis in dairy cattle and contraceptive use dynamics in Indonesia. For each application we show where the reparameterisation techniques can be used and assess their performance."

            "description" : "Conducting an exit poll to forecast the outcome of a national election in terms of both votes and seats is particularly difficult in Britain. No official information is available on how individual polling stations voted in the past, use of single-member plurality means that there is no consistent relationship between votes and seats, electors can choose to vote by post and most of those who vote in person do so late in the day. In addition, around one in every six intended exit poll respondents refuses to participate. Methods that were developed to overcome these problems, and their use in the successful 2005 British Broadcasting Corporation\u2013Independent Television exit poll, are described and evaluated. The methodology included a panel design to allow the estimation of electoral change at local level, coherent multiple-regression modelling of multiparty electoral change to capture systematic patterns of variation, probabilistic prediction of constituency winners to account for uncertainty in projected constituency level shares, collection of information about the voting intentions of postal voters before polling day and access to interviewer guesses on the voting behaviour of refusals. The coverage and accuracy of the exit poll data are critically examined, the effect of key aspects of the statistical modelling of the data is assessed and some general lessons are drawn for the design and analysis of electoral exit polls."

By converting such data to multiple binomial responses, dependencies between the decisions of the judges as well as possible association structures between the attributes can be incorporated in the model, providing an advantage over parallel univariate analyses of individual attributes. The approach outlined gives parameters which can be interpreted as (conditional) log\u2013odds and log\u2013odds ratios. As the model is a generalised linear model, parameter estimation can use standard software and the GLM framework can be used to test hypotheses on these parameters."

Such a typology will be relevant for various aspects of the work of the ESRC National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM) as well as other ESRC initiatives and the wider social science research community. It may be useful, for example, for the prioritisation of research methods, for defining the current focus of research, for the identification of  needs for further training and research within certain areas and for a classification of research projects and funding schemes. This paper describes other approaches to such a classification, in particular the thesaurus of social research methodology developed by the  SRM-Documentation Centre at the University Rotterdam. It is apparent that there is not a unique classification scheme and that various approaches to such a classification are possible. Aims and possible uses of the typology developed here are discussed. Some justification for the chosen structure is presented. Difficulties encountered in the development of the typology are described."

            "description" : "The National Centre for Research Methods will be holding its fourth residential training event targeted at early career researchers - this year an autumn rather than a summer school - between November 12th to 14th. The theme this year is on the challenges and opportunities of new sources of data and methods for their analysis. Our starting point is the recent assertion of Mike Savage and Roger Burrows (Sociology, 41, 5, 2007) that academic social scientists are losing their monopoly on innovative methods and sources of data in the face of a serious challenge from research expertise and new data sources available outside of academia. A key aim of the autumn school is to challenge this view through exploring recent developments in relation to the types of data and approaches to their analysis increasingly available to academic researchers."

Up to two children in a family reported on their relationships with their siblings resulting in a maximum of three sibling dyads per family. Mothers reported on predictor variables. One-hundred and nineteen families with 218 children as targets took part. A cross-classified, multilevel model allowed for the partitioning of variance into family, informant, target, mutuality and dyad. Sibling negativity was found to cluster significantly within families, whereas sibling affection showed no familial clustering. Variance partitioning showed that the bulk of the variance for sibling affection was attributable to mutuality and informant effects. Family, dyadic and individual level predictors of change in sibling affection and hostility were identified."

            "description" : "The focus of this contribution is on the changing patterns of offending among young people (aged 16\u201320 years) over time. Using six \u2018birth cohorts\u2019 aged 16\u201320 in the late 1960s, early 1970s, late 1970s, early 1980s, late 1980s, early 1990s and late 1990s, the study shows that crime participation \u2013 in terms of the proportions ever convicted \u2013 declined for both males and females. There has also been an overall shift from more \u2018specialist\u2019 criminal behaviour to more \u2018versatile\u2019 behaviour. While the gap between male and female offending is narrowing, the differences remain large. Although fewer young people are coming before the courts, the changing case mix has probably influenced the perception that offending is getting worse. As those committing \u2018lesser\u2019 offences are being dealt with by other means, there are higher proportions of young people coming before the courts who exhibit greater versatility and more violence."

The study used  multiple methods to assess parents\u2019 satisfaction with aspects of their care which  thus allow us some insights into methodological issues in the numerical rating of  satisfaction. It is increasingly being recognised that \u2018satisfaction\u2019 is a complex  construct whose measurement is problematic. There is a growing literature on  this topic, including a systematic review published by the NHS R&D Health  Technology Assessment programme (Crow et al 2002). In the present paper, we  will outline some of the specific issues in measuring and defining satisfaction  which arose in this study and which we believe have much wider applicability.  Although they inevitably serve to draw attention to the limitations of numerical  scoring of satisfaction, they also illuminate the concept of satisfaction and enrich  our understanding of it."

While administrative data are not necessarily the preserve of government, most  government departments keep records of the variety of services they deliver and the  processes they register in considerable detail, often storing this information as electronic  records that relate to individuals and/or organisations and summarising these data for  statistical purposes."

            "description" : "Whether novel or mundane, for many the concept of the archive does seem to produce some kind of \u2018mal d\u2019archive\u2019, an archive fever, whether following Derrida or Steedman, which merits further attention. We might understand ethics as the \u2018mal d\u2019archive\u2019 for sociologists, as the site of sociologists\u2019 anxieties about, resistance to, and general feverishness about the archive. Sociological resistance to archiving partly revolves around questions of the meaning of informed consent when future use of data cannot be anticipated; with the challenges of maintaining confidentiality and the possible limitations to use of data when data has been anonymised, and stripped of identifying names and places. Yet oral historians have long been grappling with ethics and informed consent with respect to interview material and transcripts. Historians who consult government records are faced with a 30 year rule, and sometimes a 100 year rule, governing access to public documents. So for historians questions of ethics are posited entirely differently. Anthropologists often face the challenge of negotiating consent over long period of fieldwork, or returns to the field over time, and even returns to their own personal archive of fieldnotes, photographs, maps, kinship diagrams and field recollections. Literary theorists frequently grapple with the challenges of bringing the privately written letters and diaries of writers and their correspondents into the public domain. Oral historians insist on history from below, on agentic subjects making history, inserting themselves into the record and on the importance of using the names of ordinary people. This seminar explores what ethical dilemmas and possible resolutions emerge out of encounters between the vulnerable, at risk subject of the social scientist, who needs to be protected by the cloaks of informed consent, anonymity and confidentiality, and the robust subject of oral history, insisting on their names and deeds being recorded for posterity, and on the project of inserting him or herself into history. This seminar will also examine the relevance of ethics at a time when mal d\u2019archive threatens to become a full blown paralysis in an age of over-information, and when the very personal, private and intimate is to be found everywhere in blogs and various online fora."

Drawing on data from a qualitative study with children aged 7\u201412 in the north of England, the authors identify five interconnected ways in which children made sense of kinship. They explore how children understood genealogical kinship conventions, creatively deployed or interpreted kin terms, and defined some unrelated others as `like family\'. The interplay between children\'s creative agency and adults\' involvement in children\'s kinship is considered."

A secondary aim of this article is to consider whether information available at the first court appearance leading to a conviction is associated with the length of a criminal career. Four key findings emerged. First, one can estimate career length from variables available at the first court conviction. Second, the risk of desistance remains constant during a period of 20 to 25 years if the offender does not immediately stop after the first conviction. Third, the most significant variable is age at first conviction. Finally, gender differences and birth cohorts are also important."

            "description" : "This study focuses on crime participation \u2013 that is, the numbers and proportion of  the population in England and Wales who are convicted of a crime between the ages of  10-25. Data on over 47,000 male and 10,000 female offenders for six specific birth  cohorts (those born in 1953, 1958, 1963, 1968, 1973 and 1978) was extracted from the  Offenders Index. We related convictions in three age groups (10-15, 16-20, 21-25) to  population estimates for these age groups.  Striking differences in the participation rates over time were observed for both  males and females. There is a remarkable decline among the 10-15 age group for more  recent cohorts which echoes the increasing use of court diversionary procedures in this  age group. There is no corresponding increase in participation for the later age groups.  These figures suggest that efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s to divert offenders away  from court convictions have been successful, and that such diversionary schemes need to  be encouraged."

This chapter describes four studies conducted in three Oriental cultures, suggesting that the relationships among social interaction, executive function, and social understanding are different in these cultures, implying that social and executive skills are underpinned by key cultural processes."

Evidence is presented here, however, that subjects\u2019 generosity can be reversed by allowing them to take a partner\u2019s money. Dictator game giving therefore does not reveal concern for consequences to others existing independently of the environment, as posited in rational choice theory. It may instead be an artefact of experimentation. Alternatively, evaluations of options depend on the composition of the choice set. Implications of these possibilities are explored for experimental methodology and charitable donations respectively. The data favour the artefact interpretation, suggesting that demand characteristics of experimental protocols merit investigation, and that economic analysis should not exclude context-specific social norms."

            "description" : "Kidnapping is a rare offence and is also rarely considered by researchers. We extracted from the England and Wales Offenders Index all 7362 offenders (93% males and 7% females) convicted of kidnapping from 1979 to 2001. We examined the time from first conviction for kidnapping to some specific subsequent serious crimes: subsequent kidnap, murder, manslaughter, or rape of a female. Two survival analysis procedures were used: Kaplan-Meier estimation as a nonparametric procedure, and the Cox proportional hazards model as a semi-parametric model. Kidnappers are more likely to be convicted of another kidnapping offence than be convicted of the more serious offences of rape of a female or homicide. One can estimate that five out of every 100 kidnapping offenders convicted of first-time kidnapping will be reconvicted for this offence within 20 years. Incontrast, one in every 100 kidnapping offenders will be convicted of homicide within 20 years, and close to two out of every 100 will be convicted of rape of a female within 20 years. Number of previous convictions is a significant risk factor for each of these serious reconvictions, with age at first kidnapping also a significant risk factor for kidnapping reconviction. Kidnappers are over 30 times more likely than males in the general population to be convicted of homicide and fourtimes more likely than sex offenders. There should be, therefore, more focus on kidnappers as a potentially dangerous set of offenders."

            "description" : "This paper examines the concept of research undertaken by children* and the methodological and theoretical issues this raises. It begins with a rationale for research by children and sets this within a context of participation and empowerment, acknowledging the importance of child perspective and voice and valuing the original contribution that child researchers can make to our understanding of childhood and children\u2019s lives. It traces the historical and philosophical precedents that have led to this point and explores the question of whether research by children can be accommodated within existing research parameters or whether it requires a new approach, even a new research paradigm? The paper also addresses issues related to ethics, policy and power relations along with a discussion of the extent to which research by children can be free of adult filters and adult influence. It draws on data from a three-year action research study empowering children as active researchers and  features examples of children\u2019s original projects."

This can be achieved by an  analysis which combines the following three critical perspectives on the category:  first, understanding the impact that contexts (both material and cultural) have  on how lone motherhood is defined and experienced; second, acknowledging  how the category \u2018lone mother\u2019 is but one aspect of a woman\u2019s life in which also  other categories such as gender, class and ethnicity intersect and interact; and  third, examining the impact that the category \u2018lone mother\u2019 has on the lives of  women. These three routes of analysis in combination allow an appreciation of  the constraints placed by social inequalities on the lives of lone mothers, while  not reducing these multi-dimensional lives to the one-dimensional category  \u2018lone mother\u2019, and could form the basis of less stigmatizing and more effective  policies."

            "description" : "In recent years, a growing number of methods for synthesising qualitative research have emerged. There is a need for researchers and commissioners to be able to distinguish between these methods and to select which method is the most appropriate to their situation.     We searched the literature, using a high sensitivity Google Scholar search, \u201Cpearl-growing\u201F techniques and by hand-searching key journals, to identify distinct approaches to qualitative meta-synthesis.     Two hundred and three papers were found and nine distinct approaches to qualitative synthesis were identified: meta-narrative synthesis, critical interpretive synthesis, meta-study, meta-ethnography, grounded formal theory, thematic synthesis, textual narrative synthesis, framework synthesis and ecological triangulation.     A number of methodological and conceptual links between these methods were identified and explored, while contrasting epistemological positions explained differences in approaches to issues such as quality assessment and extent of iteration. Methods broadly fall into \u201Crealist\u201F or \u201Cidealist\u201F epistemologies. Commissioners of qualitative syntheses might wish to consider the kind of product they want and select their method \u2013 or type of method \u2013 accordingly."

            "format" :      "application/pdf",
            "description" : "Kidnapping is a rare offence and is also rarely considered by researchers. We  extracted from the England and Wales Offenders Index all 7587 offenders (93%  males and 7% females) convicted of kidnapping from 1979 to 2001. We  examined the time from the first conviction for kidnapping to some specific  subsequent serious crimes: a subsequent kidnap, murder, manslaughter, and  rape of a female. Two survival analysis procedures - the Kaplan-Meier estimates  as a nonparametric procedure, and the Cox proportional hazards model as a  semi-parametric model - were used. Thus, one can estimate that 5 out of every  100 kidnap offenders convicted of kidnapping will be reconvicted for this offence.  In contrast, one in every 100 kidnap offenders will be convicted of homicide after  20 years and close to 2 out of every 100 will be convicted of rape of a female in  20 years. The number of previous conviction is a significant risk factor for each  of these serious reconvictions. Kidnappers are over 30 times more likely than  males in the general population to be convicted of homicide and four times more  likely than sex offenders. There should be, therefore, more focus on kidnappers  as a potentially dangerous set of offenders."

            "description" : "It is now commonplace for policy-makers, think -tanks and social scientists to call  for increased public participation in science and technology policy (e.g. House of  Lords, 2000; Wilsden and Willis, 2004; CST, 2005). Nowhere is this more  apparent than in stem cell science. The recent Pattison report1 on the UK Stem  Cell Initiative called on the government to invest at least \u00A3350m in stem cell  research by 2016 and also stressed the importance of maintaining a \u2018close liaison  of parties involved in developing regulation and public dialogue on stem cell  research\u2019 (recommendations 8 & 11). Whilst laudable, the idea of increased  participation is not without its problems. For example, one frequently expressed  concern is that public dialogue comes too late in the process to effect any  significant change. From this perspective, consultation exercises are seen as  ways of re-building trust so that what is presented as an exercise in democratic  participation can often be interpreted as an investigation into how to gain support  of the public (cf Irwin, 2001, 2006; Rayner, 2003; Rowe and Frewer, 2004)."

The first one is the generalized estimating equations (GEE2) which uses an approximation of the marginal likelihood to derive the joint moments whilst the second approach uses the maximum of the approximate likelihood. We illustrate these methods with a simulation study and with an analysis of real data from a quality of life."

            "description" : "Adjusting for several unmeasured confounders is a challenging problem in the analysis of observational  data. Information about unmeasured confounders is sometimes available from external  validation data, such as surveys or secondary samples drawn from the same source population.  In principal, the validation permits us to recover information about the missing data, but the  difficulty is in eliciting a valid model for nuisance distribution of the unmeasured confounders.  Motivated by a British study of the effects of trihalomethane exposure on full-term low birthweight,  we describe a flexible Bayesian procedure for adjusting for a vector of unmeasured  confounders using external validation data. We summarize the unmeasured confounders with a  scalar summary score using the propensity score methodology of Rosenbaum and Rubin. The  score has the property that it breaks the dependence between the exposure and unmeasured  confounders within levels of measured confounders. To adjust for unmeasured confounding in a  Bayesian analysis, we need only update and adjust for the summary score during Markov chain  Monte Carlo simulation. We demonstrate that trihalomethane exposure is associated with increased  risk of full-term low birthweight, and this association persists even after adjusting for  eight unmeasured confounders. Empirical results from simulation illustrate that our proposed  method eliminates bias from several unmeasured confounders, even in small samples."

            "description" : "In many longitudinal studies, the outcomes recorded on each subject include both a sequence of repeated measurements at pre-specified times and the time at which an event of particular interest occurs: for example, death, recurrence of symptoms or drop out from the study. The event time for each subject may be recorded exactly, interval censored or right censored. The term joint modelling refers to the statistical analysis of the resulting data while taking account of any association between the repeated measurement and time-to-event outcomes. In this paper, we first discuss different approaches to joint modelling and argue that the analysis strategy should depend on the scientific focus of the study. We then describe in detail a particularly simple, fully parametric approach. Finally, we use this approach to re-analyse data from a clinical trial of drug therapies for schizophrenic patients, in which the event time is an interval-censored or right-censored time to withdrawal from the study due to adverse side effects.

            "description" : "Traditional studies of school differences in educational achievement use  multilevel modelling techniques to take into account the nesting of pupils within schools.  However, educational data are known to have more complex non-hierarchical structures. The  potential importance of such structures is apparent when considering the impact of pupil  mobility during secondary schooling on educational achievement. Movements of pupils  between schools suggest that we should model pupils as belonging to the series of schools  attended and not just their final school. Since these school moves are strongly linked to  residential moves, it is important to additionally explore whether achievement is also affected  by the history of neighbourhoods lived in. Using the national pupil database, this paper  combines multiple membership and cross-classified multilevel models to simultaneously  explore the relationships between secondary school, primary school, neighbourhood and  educational achievement. The results show a negative relationship between pupil mobility  and achievement, the strength of which depends greatly on the nature and timing of these  moves. Accounting for pupil mobility also reveals that schools and neighbourhoods are more  important than shown by previous analysis. A strong primary school effect appears to last  long after a child has left that phase of schooling. The additional impact of neighbourhoods,  on the other hand, is small. Crucially, the rank order of school effects across all types of  pupils is sensitive to whether we account for the complexity of the multilevel data structure."

            "description" : "The main aim of this paper is to identify those school-level and locality-level factors that significantly affect each of the three stages in a young adult\'s educational trajectory in North West England: GCSE results, track taken at age 16 and \'A\'-level scores. By applying three-level models to data collected as part of the EFFNATIS project, we find no evidence of any locality-level effects. Overall, none of the explanatory variables conventionally considered to affect educational attainment had a consistent effect across all three stages. Rather, each explanatory variable had a contingent effect at specific points within the overall trajectory of educational outcomes."

            "description" : "It is one thing to be able to count and share items proficiently, but it is another thing to know how counting and sharing establish and identify quantity. The aim of the study was to identify which measures of numerical knowledge predict children\'s success on simple number problems, where counting and set equivalence are at issue. Seventy-two 5-year-olds were given a battery of nine tasks on each of three sessions (at 3-monthly intervals). Tasks measured procedural proficiency, conceptual understanding (using an error-detection paradigm) and the ability to compare sets using number knowledge. Procedural skills remained fairly stable over the 6-month period, and preceded children\'s ability to detect another\'s violations to those procedures. Regression analysis revealed that children who are sensitive to procedural errors in another\'s counting and sharing are more likely to recognize the significance of cardinal numbers for set comparisons. We suggest that although children\'s conceptual understanding of well-rehearsed routines is often limited, conceptual insight might be achieved by setting tasks that require reflection rather than practice."

The great strength  of administrative data is that they have information on almost everyone. However, the  main weakness is that they often lack important variables; for instance, the National Pupil  Database (NPD) has detailed information on children\'s educational outcomes but no  information on the parent\'s education or employment status. In contrast, survey data  provide very rich information. Clearly, there is scope for using survey data to enhance  administrative data. An important weakness of survey data is that, unlike administrative  data, they include only a sample of individuals and suffer from problems such as nonresponse,  attrition, and recall bias. Clearly, there is scope for using administrative data to  enhance survey data."

It investigates methods that address narrative syntax,  meanings, and contexts. It looks at ethics; data selection, gathering, transcribing and analysis;  and the drawing of local and more general conclusions from narrative research. It also explores  the theoretical assumptions operating, often implicitly, within narrative research perspectives. As  well as drawing on key research texts in the field, the paper uses examples from the author\u2019s  interview studies of people\u2019s stories of living with HIV. The paper ends with some study  questions, and a list of primary readings."

The interpersonal circumplex (IPC) provided the theoretical framework and data were analyzed using a multilevel social relations model; in addition, genetic effects were estimated for individual effects.  Substantial individual and relationship effects were identified for both positivity and negativity.  The positive between-person reciprocity correlations, significant for positivity and negativity, gave strong support for a process of complementarity. Complementarity was lowest in dyads with high power differential (i.e. parent-child dyads). Individual effects were stronger for parents than children.  Genetic influences were found to explain a substantial proportion of the individual effects for both positivity and negativity. The findings will help to expand the IPC to interactional partners that know one another well."

            "description" : "This methodological paper reviews the research literature and discusses the issues that arise in conducting qualitative research with people for whom traditional methods of qualitative research might present challenges for researchers. The focus is on children and adults with learning difficulties, communication difficulties or other disabilities such as autism with associated complex challenges in communicating, understanding and taking part in qualitative research. The paper\u2019s structure follows the stages of conducting research and includes design, ethics, data collection, analysis and reporting. Both methodological challenges in common with researching other groups (including other so-called vulnerable groups, minority  groups and hard to reach groups as well as mainstream participants) and those unique to research with this disabled group are addressed, culminating in guidance for researchers on methods, approaches and key issues. Recurrent themes include: techniques for communicating abstract ideas to participants, enabling participants to express their views and tell of their experiences, ways of acting responsibly and ways of acting inclusively. The review  illuminates some of developments in what can be achieved in research with people with learning and communication difficulties and some of limitations in what has been managed to date. The review was commissioned by NCRM in 2008."

            "format" :      "application/pdf",
            "description" : "Anonymity and confidentiality of participants are central to ethical research practice  in social research. Where possible, researchers aim to assure participants that every  effort will be made to ensure that the data they provide can not be traced back to them  in reports, presentations and other forms of dissemination. The primary method  researchers use to preserve anonymity and confidentiality is the use of pseudonyms  for participants and also for the location of the research. In addition, other practices,  such as changing the reported characteristics of participants (such as gender or  occupation) are also used by some researchers to conceal identities and thereby  maintain the confidentiality of the data provided by participants. There are several  issues that such practices raise. One is that it is difficult for researchers to know how  far to take anonymisation of individuals in order for them not to be identifiable, given  that research findings may be presented to a variety of audiences, including members  of participants\u2019 communities. A second issue is that research participants hold  differing views about the desirability of anonymisation, presenting researchers with  difficult choices between respecting the preferences of those participants who wish to  be identifiable and those who prefer to remain anonymous. A third issue is that of  whether or not to attempt the anonymisation of the location of the research, which  may be adjudged more or less practical or impractical (depending on its  distinctiveness) and more or less desirable (depending on its importance in providing  the social context of the analysis that is being developed). This paper explores these  issues by looking at how they have been handled by researchers in the field of  community sociology (broadly defined) who have used visual data in their reports. This analysis allows the argument to be developed that although the issues themselves  are not new, the ways in which they are handled by researchers are necessarily  evolving in the context of technological change, the growth of research regulation,  and shifts in the expectations of research that participants hold."

An inferential methodology based on the marginal pairwise likelihood approach is proposed. This method belonging to the broad class of composite likelihood involves marginal pairs probabilities of the responses which has analytical expression for the probit version of the model, from where we derived those of the logit version. The different results are illustrated with a simulation study and with an analysis of a real data from health-related quality of life."

Cognitive hierarchy theory  explains coordination as the result of common beliefs about players\u2019 pre-reflective  inclinations towards the relevant strategies; the theory of team reasoning explains it as the  result of the players\u2019 using a non-standard form of reasoning. We report two experiments.  One finds strong support for team reasoning; the other supports cognitive hierarchy theory.  In the light of additional questionnaire evidence, we conclude that players\u2019 reasoning is  sensitive to the decision context."

            "description" : "This paper is written as a practical and accessible guide to some key issues in  mixed methods research. It explores six broad strategies that can underpin the  mixing of methods and linking of different forms of data, be they qualitative,  quantitative, or spanning this divide. It does this in a context where mixing  methods has come to be seen as a good thing, and where research funders are  increasingly thought to look favourably upon research proposals involving more  than one method for generating and analysing data. Yet mixing methods for  no good reason other than the sake of it can produce disjointed and unfocussed  research, and can severely test the capabilities of researchers. Researchers  engaging in mixed methods research need to have a clear sense of the logic and  purpose of their approach and of what they are trying to achieve, because this  ultimately must underpin their practical strategy not only for choosing and  deploying a particular mix of methods, but crucially also for linking their data  analytically. The paper outlines challenges and opportunities that each of the  six strategies brings for mixed methods practice and analysis, giving each a  verdict."

            "description" : "In England, so-called \u2018league tables\u2019 based upon examination results and test scores are published annually, ostensibly to inform parental choice of secondary schools. A crucial limitation of these tables is that the most recent published information is based on the current performance of a cohort of pupils who entered secondary schools several years earlier, whereas for choosing a school it is the future performance of the current cohort that is of interest. We show that there is substantial uncertainty in predicting such future performance and that incorporating this uncertainty leads to a situation where only a handful of schools\u2019 future performances can be separated from both the overall mean and from one another with an acceptable degree of precision. This suggests that school league tables, including value-added ones, have very little to offer as guides to school choice."

It considers the convictions of six cohorts involving 31,456 young adults aged 16\u201320 in the early 1970s, the late 1970s, the early 1980s, the late 1980s, the early 1990s and the late 1990s. Using latent class analysis, 16 offence clusters for males and five offence clusters for females were identified. For both males and females, the proportions of the population convicted in the 16\u201320 age group have declined. Among the males, \u2018versatile\u2019 clusters are increasing and \u2018specialist\u2019 clusters, with some exceptions, are rapidly declining. Among females, the proportions in the versatile cluster have increased appreciably, while the specialist cluster of violence has increased and that of shoplifting has decreased. We suggest that the impact of these changes has not been fully understood by important official definers of crime, such as judges and magistrates."

The analysis is carried out on the basis of a multivariate latent Markov model which allows for discrete covariates affecting the initial and the transition probabilities of the latent process. We also show some simplifications which reduce the number of parameters substantially; we include a Rasch-like parameterization of the conditional distribution of the response variables given the latent process and a constraint of partial homogeneity of the latent Markov chain. For the maximum likelihood estimation of the model we outline an EM algorithm based on recursions known in the hidden Markov literature, which make the estimation feasible also when the number of time occasions is large. Through this model, we analyse the conviction histories of a cohort of offenders who were born in England and Wales in 1953. The final model identifies five latent classes and specifies common transition probabilities for males and females between 5-year age periods, but with different initial probabilities."

            "description" : "The gnm package provides facilities for fitting generalized nonlinear models, i.e., regression models in which the linktransformed  mean is described as a sum of predictor terms, some of which may be non-linear in the unknown parameters.  Linear and generalized linear models, as handled by the lm and glm functions in R, are included in the class of generalized  nonlinear models, as the special case in which there is no nonlinear term.  This document gives an extended overview of the gnm package, with some examples of applications. The primary  package documentation in the form of standard help pages, as viewed in R by, for example, ?gnm or help(gnm), is  supplemented rather than replaced by the present document.  We begin below with a preliminary note (Section 2) on some ways in which the gnm package extends R\u2019s facilities  for specifying, fitting and working with generalized linear models. Then (Section 3 onwards) the facilities for nonlinear  terms are introduced, explained and exemplified.  The gnm package is installed in the standard way for CRAN packages, for example by using install.packages.  Once installed, the package is loaded into an R session by"
